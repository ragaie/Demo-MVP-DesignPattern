# This demo using MVP :-

## There is many another layer just for supporting demo app not compitable with real app.

1- service layer: it is native layer to request data 

2- cached layer: simple layer to cached data direct to json file witout making operation in saved data.

3- Internet provided by apple to check interent connection.
## All comuncation between layers done throw protocol.


1- For service manger layer it is two small to fit all cases of large application, it just small functionality for this demo

2- also there no design pattern add to handel dependancies, it handled manual for every model, So for real app will handle it
by composstion root or Swinject or any other way.

So dependancies handling not pretty one in this task.


# Have good time in cheecking it.

# Thanks.
